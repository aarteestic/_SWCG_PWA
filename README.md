# Shadow Wizard Reviews
This progressive web app (PWA) is the HSC Task 1 project for the group Shadow Wizard Coding Gang.

## Note:

Run the PWA app (in Visual Studio) with a virtual environment to negate the need to download dependencies.

Activate the virtual environment by inserting in your terminal:
`
.venv\Scripts\activate
`

### If that doesn't work,
You may try downloading the dependencies, done in your terminal with:
`
pip install flask flask-bcrypt
`
